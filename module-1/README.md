## Instructions

All modules should have this folder structure:

- top level module folder
  - includes
    - 0-unitname.md
    - 1-unitname.md
    - 2-unitname.md
    - etc.md
  - media
    - yourimagefile.png
  - 0-unitname.yml
  - 1-unitname.yml
  - 2-unitname.yml
  - index.yml

In **each** .yml file, please fill out all commented fields to the best of your ability. If you have any questions, reach out to Shana.

## Knowledge checks

Knowledge checks live inline in a unit's .yml file. It can be tedious to put them in with the correct syntax so if you'd like, you can instead put them in the unit's .md file in a reasonable format and we will translate them.
